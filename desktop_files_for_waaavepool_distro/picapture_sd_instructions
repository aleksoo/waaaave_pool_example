how to change from usb (default setting of this and all the 
waaave pool distro firmwares) to picapture sd inputs

1.click on the folder icon at the top left of the 
screen and navigate to 
pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAAVE_POOL_MAIN/src/ofApp.cpp
double click on it, it will open up in this text editor.
scroll down a tiny bit and you will see the lines

	//0 is picaputre, 1 is usbinput
	bool inputswitch=0;
	
change the number 0 to the number 1 so it looks like

	//0 is picaputre, 1 is usbinput
	bool inputswitch=1;	

hit ctrl-s on your keyboard and then in the folder navigator hit the up arrow twice and then
right click on WAAAVE_POOL_MAIN and select 'open in terminal'
once it is opened in terminal enter 'make' and hit enter
a bunch of text should scroll for about 1 minute and then you will see


make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN'
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN'
pi@raspberrypi:~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN $ 

type 'reboot', hit enter and the waaave pool should start up again with the picapture sd
enabled by default.  note that you will need to have a video source coming in to
the capture card in order for the waaave pool to start up correctly.  you will
know that a source is detected if there is a tiny blue led lit
up adjacent to the s-video port.

to switch back to usb input simple repeat the above steps and plug
edit the line to say 	

	//0 is picaputre, 1 is usbinput
	bool inputswitch=0;
	
once again.  	


*note* the script i'm using to auto run the waaave_pool code
on start up has a side effect where like it'll auto run when
like terminals and other kinds of files are opend.  all you need
to do is hit escape whenever this happens and continue on with
the instructions.  modifying this script is kind of for 
medium advanced folks, if interested do a search on '.bashrc
auto run raspbian' and you'll see what i did.
