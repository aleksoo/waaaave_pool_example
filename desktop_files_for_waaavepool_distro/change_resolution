so there are a couple of steps to trying out the different
output resolutions!  this is an experimental mode and i am 
not planning on making seperate images for this as of
quite yet.

*note* the script i'm using to auto run the waaave_pool code
on start up has a side effect where like it'll auto run when
like terminals and other kinds of files are opend.  all you need
to do is hit escape whenever this happens and continue on with
the instructions.  modifying this script is kind of for 
medium advanced folks, if interested do a search on '.bashrc
auto run raspbian' and you'll see what i did.

1. first click on the raspberry in the upper left corner
(or hit window key on keyboard) and navigate to 
preferences->raspberry pi configuration, then
click/tab over to "set resolution".  default mode
is 
"CEA Mode 2" which is 480p
the other possible resolutions you can try will be
"CEA Mode 4" 720p
and
"CEA Mode 16" 1080p

2.  hit ok on the one you want to try, and then ok 
on the preferences pane.  it will ask if you would like
to reboot now, say no

3. next click on the folder icon at the top left of the 
screen and navigate to 
pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAAVE_POOL_MAIN/src/main.cpp
double click on this and it will open up next to these instructions

4. scroll down a tiny bit and you will see this

	//CEA mode 2
	settings.setSize(720,480);
	
	//CEA mode 4
	//settings.setSize(1280,720);
	
	//CEA mode 16
	//settings.setSize(1920,1080);
	
in this context '//' is referred to as commenting out, this
is an instruction to the compiler to ignore any lines of
text following the //.  what you will need to do is 
make sure to comment out any CEA mode you are not using
and to uncomment (delete the '//') the line under the CEA
mode you are using.  for example if i am trying out CEA
mode 4 720p then it should look like this
	
	//CEA mode 2
	//settings.setSize(720,480);
	
	//CEA mode 4
	settings.setSize(1280,720);
	
	//CEA mode 16
	//settings.setSize(1920,1080);	
	
once you have finished this, hit ctrl-s on your keyboard and close
main.cpp	

5. in the folder navigator hit the up arrow twice and then
right click on WAAAVE_POOL_MAIN and select 'open in terminal'
once it is opened in terminal enter 'make' and hit enter
a bunch of text should scroll for about 1 minute and then you will see


make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN'
make[1]: Leaving directory '/home/pi/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN'
pi@raspberrypi:~/openFrameworks/apps/myApps/WAAVE_POOOL_MAIN $ 

type 'reboot', hit enter and the waaave pool should start up again with the new
resolution.  note that resolutions larger than 480p will result
in framerates lower than 30fps.  this should not affect composite
video modes at all.
