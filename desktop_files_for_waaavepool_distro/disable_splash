how to disable splash screen.  
1.open a terminal and esc out of the auto running waaave pool.
2.enter 'gksudo pcmanfm' to open up a file manager window with 
priveleges.
3. navigate to /usr/share/plymouth/themes/pix
4. rename 'splash.png' to something else like 'splash0.png'
5. rename 'black.png' to 'splash.png'
6. ok now restart and double check that it worked!
I find the splash screen to be useful for troubleshooting and for
diagnostics but understand that its not preferable for if one
needs to restart their system during a live show!
