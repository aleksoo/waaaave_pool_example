hello and welcome to the waaaves pool!  to get started with this program you will need a raspberry pi(i built and tested this in raspbian on a raspberry pi 3 b v1.2), a usb camera (all images and demo videos were made with a logitech c310 which can be found very affordably on ebay.  i highly reccomend only logitech usb cameras as the only brand im aware of with consistent driver support cross platforms), a usb keyboard for controls.  There is option to support a usb midi keyboard as well(the default midi controls are mapped to the default cc values for the knobs on a korg nanostudio in the current version, there are instructions on midi mapping below)
